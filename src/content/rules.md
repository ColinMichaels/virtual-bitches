# BISCUITS: How To Play

<div class="rules-callout">
  <strong>Goal:</strong> finish with the <strong>lowest total score</strong>.  
  Every scored die is worth <strong>(max face - rolled face)</strong>, so high rolls are good and low rolls are expensive.
</div>

## Quick Start

1. Roll all dice in play.
2. Select one or more dice.
3. Score selected dice (they are removed from the pool).
4. Repeat until all dice are scored.

The game ends when every die has been scored.

## Dice Pool

Base pool is 15 dice total:

- 12 x d6
- 1 x d8
- 1 x d10
- 1 x d12

Variant options (Settings -> Game Variants) can swap some d6 slots for:

- d20
- d4
- second d10
- d100 mode (paired d10 tens/ones behavior)

## Scoring

Formula:

`points = die max value - rolled value`

| Die | Perfect Roll | Perfect Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| d4 | 4 | 0 |
| d6 | 6 | 0 |
| d8 | 8 | 0 |
| d10 | 10 | 0 |
| d12 | 12 | 0 |
| d20 | 20 | 0 |

Lower total score wins.

## Modes And Rooms

### Multiplayer Session Recovery

  - Return to Lobby
  - Continue Solo
- Continuing solo keeps your run moving immediately.
- Returning to lobby takes you back to room selection/creation.

## Tutorial

- Tutorial is an interactive guided flow (roll, select, score).
- At completion, the tutorial scoring step is auto-undone so you can optimize your selection.
- A highlight pulse marks restored dice.
- You can replay tutorial anytime from this screen using the **Replay Tutorial** button, or before a run from the splash screen.
