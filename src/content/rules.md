# Bitches (a Dice Game) — Quick Rules + Fun Table Talk

A fast, push-your-luck dice game where every roll feels like a small life decision… and your friends will absolutely comment on all of them.

---

## Components
- **15 dice total:** **11× d6**, **1× d8**, **1× d10**, **1× d12**, and **1× custom “Bitches” (or “Biscuits”) die**
- **Dice bag** (for maximum drama when you shake it)

> **Family-friendly mode:** “Biscuits” is the same game with a cleaner label on the custom die.

---

## Objective
You’re chasing **perfect rolls** (the highest face on each die), because in this game:

**Lower score wins.**

---

## Key Terms
- **A “Bitch/Biscuit”** = the **highest value** on a die
  - d6 → **6**
  - d8 → **8**
  - d10 → **0 counts as 10** (highest)
  - d12 → **12**
  - custom die → its highest face

---

## How to Play (One Player Turn)
1. **Roll all dice currently in play.**
2. **Choose at least one die to score (set aside).**
  - You can set aside as many as you want, but **you must set aside at least one** every roll.
3. **Re-roll the remaining dice.**
4. Repeat until **all dice have been set aside/scored**.

Then the next player goes. After everyone plays, compare scores.

## Scoring (Reverse Scoring — simple and fast)
When you score a die, you score the **difference from perfect**:

**Score = (max value on that die) − (value rolled).**

Examples:
- d6 showing **6** → **6 − 6 = 0**
- d12 showing **10** → **12 − 10 = 2**
- d8 showing **1** → **8 − 1 = 7**

**Winner:** the player with the **lowest total score**.

## The Fun Game Moments (what you’ll feel at the table)

### 1) “Free Zero” Temptation
You roll a couple perfect dice early (0 points).  
Do you grab them immediately… or get greedy and chase even more perfect dice?

### 2) The Shrinking-Pool Squeeze
As your dice pool gets smaller, “safe” perfect rolls get harder to hit.  
This is where the game turns into a slow-motion train wreck—sometimes in your favor.

### 3) The Late-Game Pain Roll
You’re down to a couple dice, you *need* a good result, and the dice say, “No.”  
That single roll can swing the whole round.

### 4) The Miracle Finish
You hit a perfect roll right when it matters most and end with a tiny score.  
Everyone immediately demands a rematch.

---

## Quick Strategy (one paragraph)
Perfect dice are usually worth banking right away because the game gets more dangerous as your pool shrinks. Most of your points tend to come from the last few rolls—so taking points early can quietly doom you unless you’re making a deliberate gamble.

## One-line teach
**"Roll everything, take at least one die out each time, score the difference from perfect, and try to finish with the lowest total."**
